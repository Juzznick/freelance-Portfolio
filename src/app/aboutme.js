            <h5 className="text-blue-300 text-2xl w-3/4 description-text">I am a passionate UI/UX designer and front-end developer focused on
                creating seamless, user-centered digital experiences. With a strong
                foundation in both design and coding, I specialize in building visually
                appealing, responsive interfaces that prioritize functionality. My expertise in
                tools like Figma, strengthened through certifications like 'User Interface
                Design with Figma' (85% score), allows me to craft clean, intuitive designs.
                In addition to design, my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enables
                me to translate concepts into fully functional websites. My experience spans
                responsive web design, user interaction, and performance optimization,
                ensuring that my work is both innovative and technically sound.</h5>
